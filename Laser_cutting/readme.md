This folder contains the laser cutting vector graphics file. For laser cutting instructions, see the [documentation](Documentation/Introduction.md), section **Laser cutting**.

This SVG vector graphics file was created for 4.7 mm thick sheets. It may also work with uneven sheets within the tolerance range of about 4.2 to 5.2 mm (testing needed).

For instructions about how to generate vector graphics for other sheet thicknesses, see the [documentation](Documentation/Introduction.md), section **Modding and upgrades**.
