# Making sheets from recycled plastics

Here are some instructions for making panels from recycled plastic using [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/) methods.

## Tools and machines needed

- Plastic shredder (like the [Precious Plastic shredder](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build/shredderpro) or similar)
- Plastic sheet press (like the [Precious Plastic sheet press](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build/sheetpress) or similar)

## Material

There are many types of plastics that can be recycled using Precious Plastic methods. However, it is recommended to use PP (polypropylene), because PP is particularly suitable for laser cutting.

## Shredding

Make sure to use only PP (polypropylene) plastics and don't mix it with any other types of plastics.

## Using purchased plastics

If you don't have enough PP plastic, you can still purchase PP (polypropylene) from online shops. It's hard to find shops for colored PP pellets, but colorless (white/translucent) PP pellets are quite common and can be purchased from many online shops.
