# Making sheets from recycled plastics

Here are some instructions for making panels from recycled plastic using [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/) methods.

## Tools and machines needed

- Plastic shredder (like the [Precious Plastic shredder](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build/shredderpro) or similar)
- Plastic sheet press (like the [Precious Plastic sheet press](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build/sheetpress) or similar)

## Material

There are many types of plastics that can be recycled using Precious Plastic methods. However, it is recommended to use **PP (polypropylene)**, because PP is particularly suitable for laser cutting.

## Shredding

Make sure to use only PP (polypropylene) plastics and don't mix it with any other types of plastics.

## Using purchased plastics

If you don't have enough PP plastic, you can still purchase PP (polypropylene) from online shops. It's hard to find shops for colored PP pellets, but colorless (white/translucent) PP pellets are quite common and can be purchased from many online shops.

## Pressing sheets

The sheets should have a thickness of about 4.7 mm. This way you can use the standard SVG file for laser cutting provided in this repository.

Sheets with a thickness of 4 to 5 mm should work well, too. When using sheets with more than 5 mm you might get trouble with laser cutting them.

### Example calculation for sheet mould and weight

A mould measuring 560 x 560 x 4 mm was used for the prototype. So the mold had a thickness of 4 mm.

However, due to some inaccuracies, sheets came out more like 4.5 to 5 mm thick.

First you should calculate the weight of the plastic you need. In this example:
- Volume = 56 x 56 x 0.45 cm =  1254.4 cm続
- Density of PP = 0.93 g/cm続
- Weight = Volume x Density = 1254.4 cm続 x 0.93 g/cm続 = 1166.592 g
- Adding 5 % : 1166.592 g x 1.5 = 1224,9216 g
  - Experience shows that the calculated amount is often not quite enough and you should add about 5 %

This example therefore results in a weight of about **1225 g**.

If you mix different colors, the sum should be 1225 g. For example, the white sheets with blue and turquoise sprinkles (as seen in the images) was mixed from:
- 1185 g white
- +20 g blue
- +20 g turquoise
  - sums up to 1225 g
 
Depending on your machine and process, these values may also vary. Several attempts should be made to determine the correct weight.
