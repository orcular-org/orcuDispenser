PP = Polypropylene

- Most of the screws and nuts are suggested to be made from Polypropylene (PP). The reasons are:
  - PP is lighter than steel, which makes the whole dispenser lighter
  - PP is recyclebale in plastic recycling machines and PP is the same material that the sheets are made from. This way, broken or used PP screws and nuts can be recycled and new sheets can be made from the PP material.
- But: You can still use steel screws and nuts instead of PP if you like

- The two M3 x 16 screws in the lid, the locknuts and wingnuts should be stainless steel. The reasons are:
  - These screws and wingnuts have to be undone everytime you want to refill your dispenser. Plastic screws and nuts tend to wear off and break quickly, so steel parts are recommended
  - Stainless steel is recommended as these parts may get in contact with water a lot (a dispenser is usually placed close to a water tap)
