# Assembly

## Part list

Make sure you have all parts:
- 3D printed parts (list [here](Introduction.md), section 3D printing)
  - 5 parts for the dispenser (3D printed)
  - 1 wrench tool (3D printed, see image below)
  - 1 drilling template (3D printed)
- Laser cut parts ((list [here](Introduction.md), section laser cutting)
  - 6 parts (laser-cut)
- Purchased parts (list [here](Introduction.md), section shopping list)
  - Pump with pipe
  - Jar with lid
  - Screws and nuts (see images below)

  ## Tool list
Check that you have all the tools you need.
- Small scissors (for removing stringing from the 3D printed parts)
- Large scissors or side cutter (for cutting the pump pipe)
- Tweezer (for putting the nuts in the 3D printed part pockets)
- Wrench for M3 nuts or small pliers (for tightening the M3 steel nuts)
- Drilling machine with 8 mm drill (drill size may vary depending on pump purchased)
- File (only needed if the parts are too thick and don't fit together)

## Arranging laser-cut parts

- Examine the six laser-cut parts from recycled plastics. For each part, decide which side you want on the outside of the dispenser (the visible side). Since all parts are symmetrical, they can be flipped to any side.
- Put the lid and bottom away for now and continue with the four side parts
- Decide which parts should be front, back, left and right
  - The **front** and **back** part are identical and can therefore be swapped
  - The **left** and **right** part are identical and can therefore be swapped

- Arrange the six side parts and the bottom part as seen in the picture below

- Make a test assembly by putting the five parts together (without using screws or nuts for now). Check if the parts fit together
  - A tight fit is ideal, but if they are a little bit loose, it's still okay
  - If the parts are too thick and can't be pushed-in, you may try to process the parts a bit using a file or laser-cut one or several parts again from another sheet
- When done with the test assembly and everything fits fine, disassamble the parts and rearrange them as in the picture above, so you will remember which part is front/back/left/right
- Leave the laser-cut parts for now and continue with the 3D printed parts

## Putting nuts and screws in the 3D printed angle brackets
