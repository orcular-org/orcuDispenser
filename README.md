The orcuDispenser (short for "Orcular Dispenser") is an open-source dispenser made from recycled plastics. The main features are:
- For soap or other liquids like dishwashing liquid, shampoo or body wash
- Made from recycled plastics ("Precious Plastic" sheets)
- Laser-cut parts
- 3D printed parts
- Circular design
  - Easy to repair & upgrade
  - Designed for disassembly
  - All parts recyclebale (except for the pump, depends on the product)
- Open-source hardware
- Designed in FreeCAD (open-source software)
  - CAD file accessible in this repository
  - Parametric design (other sizes are easy to generate)

## About the Orcular project
The orcuDispenser is part of the Orcular project - https://www.orcular.org

"Orcular" stands for **O**pen Source + Ci**rcular** Economy

The project is about design concepts for locally recyclable products - for a constantly growing open source product library and the development of inner-city production.

Most components can be recycled into new parts - all within one city.
Recyclable plastic parts from the laser cutter, 3D printer and CNC mill, supplemented by standard parts.
